# Test Code Analysis Prompt

You are analyzing the test suite of a repository. Based on the provided test files, provide a comprehensive analysis.

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Testing Strategy
- What testing framework(s) are used?
- What types of tests are present (unit, integration, e2e)?
- What is the overall testing approach?

### 2. Test Coverage
- What areas of the codebase are tested?
- Are there any obvious gaps in test coverage?
- How comprehensive is the test suite?

### 3. Test Organization
- How are tests structured and organized?
- Is there a clear naming convention?
- How are test fixtures and helpers organized?
- Are there shared test utilities?

### 4. Test Quality
- Are tests isolated and independent?
- Is there appropriate use of mocking/stubbing?
- Do tests follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)?
- Are edge cases and error conditions tested?

### 5. Notable Patterns
- Any testing patterns worth highlighting?
- Creative approaches to testing difficult code?
- Good examples of test design?

## Output Format

Provide a structured markdown analysis that would help someone:
1. Understand the testing approach
2. Run and extend the test suite
3. Identify areas that may need more testing

Use headers, bullet points, and code references where helpful. Aim for 300-500 words.
