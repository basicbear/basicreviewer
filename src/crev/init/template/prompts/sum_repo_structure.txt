# Repository Structure Analysis Prompt

You are analyzing a repository's organizational structure based on its file categorization. Your task is to summarize how the codebase is organized.

## Analysis Requirements

Based on the file categorization provided, analyze and describe:

### 1. Directory Organization
- What is the top-level directory structure?
- How are files organized within each major directory?
- Are there clear boundaries between different parts of the codebase?

### 2. Code Distribution
- How is the code distributed across app, test, and infra categories?
- What is the approximate ratio of application code to test code?
- Are there any notable patterns in file organization?

### 3. Project Type Assessment
- What type of project is this (CLI tool, web app, library, service, etc.)?
- What programming language(s) appear to be primary?
- What build/package system is being used?

### 4. Architecture Indicators
- Does the structure suggest any architectural patterns (MVC, layered, modular)?
- Are there signs of separation of concerns?
- Is there a clear entry point for the application?

## Output Format

Provide a concise markdown summary (200-400 words) that would help someone quickly understand:
1. What the project is
2. How it's organized
3. Where to find different types of code

Focus on high-level patterns rather than listing every file. Use headers and bullet points for clarity.
