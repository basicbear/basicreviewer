# Application Code Analysis Prompt

You are analyzing the application/business logic code of a repository. Based on the provided source files, provide a comprehensive analysis.

## Analysis Requirements

### 1. Core Functionality
- What is the main purpose of this application?
- What are the primary features implemented?
- What problem does this code solve?

### 2. Architecture & Design
- What architectural patterns are used (MVC, layered, microservices, etc.)?
- How are components/modules organized?
- What are the main abstractions and how do they interact?
- Are there any notable design patterns (factory, singleton, observer, etc.)?

### 3. Key Components
- What are the main entry points?
- What are the core services/classes/functions?
- How does data flow through the application?
- What external dependencies are used and why?

### 4. Code Quality Indicators
- Is there evidence of SOLID principles?
- How is error handling approached?
- Are there clear interfaces/contracts between components?
- What patterns support maintainability?

### 5. Technical Highlights
- Any particularly clever or well-designed code?
- Any areas that show strong engineering practices?
- Notable algorithms or implementations?

## Output Format

Provide a structured markdown analysis that would help someone:
1. Understand what the application does
2. Navigate the codebase effectively
3. Understand the design decisions made

Use headers, bullet points, and code references where helpful. Aim for 400-800 words.
